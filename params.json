{"name":"Asn.1-decoder-python","tagline":"Open Source ASN.1 decoder written in Python ","body":"###Short Project Description\r\n\r\nOpen Source ASN.1 decoder written in Python (2.7) \r\n\r\n###Main Project Text\r\n\r\nThis is a ASN.1 decoder written entirely in Python (2.7). It is meant to be run from the command line and to write its output to standard out. Of course, standard out can be redirected as need be. The ASN.1 input comes from a file (in several different formats).\r\n\r\nThe most important features are OID decoding into useable text and nested object analysis. Many ASN.1 objects contain nested text, byte arrays, and bit strings that may or may not be ASN.1 objects in their own right. Optionally this program checks nested objects for ASN.1 and formats them as ASN.1 if possible.\r\n\r\n###Dependencies\r\n\r\nPython 2.7 for now. Should work with earlier versions of Python. Has not been tested with Python 3+ so far. \r\n\r\n###Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nThere really aren't any. Just put the main Python file where ever you need it and run it.\r\n\r\n###Code License\r\n\r\nMIT License (essentially no restrictions of any kind)\r\n\r\n###Authors\r\n\r\nPeter Schaeffer\r\n\r\n#Contact\r\n\r\npeter_schaeffer@yahoo.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
